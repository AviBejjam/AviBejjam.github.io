*Overview:*
In today's data-rich world, finding relevant information quickly and efficiently is more crucial than ever. The need to find relevant information is more than just crucial. Reading through 1000s of text is a very cumbersome task and so, here we have our multi-document summarization model designed to revolutionize how we extract key insights from vast documents. Our project has a clear goal, to develop an innovative system that seamlessly integrates with user queries, identifying relevant content across multiple documents, summarizing it, and presenting it in a coherent manner. Our project involves an approach to multi-document summarization, integrating various techniques and libraries to efficiently extract key insights from diverse sources of text. Using regular expressions facilitated by libraries like 're', we ensure precise pattern matching and text manipulation. Font-based extraction capabilities enabled by Pdfplumber and PyPDF enhanced our system's accuracy in extracting text from PDF documents, while HTML parsing facilitated by Beautiful Soup extended our reach to web-based content. To enhance accessibility and usability, we've utilized APIs, allowing seamless integration of our summarization system with other applications. The core of our summarization process lies in the implementation of a modified version of the TextRank algorithm, powered by Spacy and PyTextRank libraries to generate concise and informative summaries from large volumes of text data. Together, these components form an innovative framework to revolutionize the way users can extract summaries from diverse sources effectively.
 
*Motivation:*
Our motivation is to simplify information retrieval in today's data-rich world. With lots of data in various sources, the challenge of efficiently extracting relevant insights has become increasingly difficult. Manual extraction is impractical due to the sheer volume of documents, often leading to time-consuming and inefficient processes. Moreover, disparate sources frequently present redundant or overlapping information, making the issue worse. Our project aims to address these challenges by providing a solution that automates the summarization process. By extracting key points from multiple documents into concise summaries, our system enhances efficiency and facilitates informed decision-making. Whether for academic research, business intelligence, or staying abreast of current affairs, our tool streamlines information retrieval, saving time and resources while maximizing the quality of insights extracted. In essence, our motivation is to offer a user-friendly solution to summarizing the vast amount of textual data in the digital era.
 
*Contribution:*
Collectively, our team has made significant contributions to the development of our multi-document summarization system. Avinash crafted intuitive user interface, devising font-based extraction methods, building the connectivity of APIs, and conducting crucial research. Santosh played a vital role in refining the user interface, preprocessing data, and utilizing APIs. Gautham's contributions encompassed dataset collection, UI refinement, and data preprocessing. Tejasree's efforts were concentrated on implementing regular expressions, font-based extraction approaches, and exploring the efficacy of TextRank algorithms. Namratha focused on fine-tuning TextRank algorithms to optimize summarization outcomes. Together as a team, our diverse contributions have been useful in shaping our model on how users extract key insights from multiple documents effectively.
